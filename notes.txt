Networks:
- Diagram of data filtering process for presentation
- Explicit adapted problem statement
- Interestingly, we saw a lot of cases where a domain appeared in the malware blacklists, and in the zone files, but the malware was first
    - So those cases didnâ€™t tell us anything about how long between registration and blacklisting
    - About half the data, so we end up with 2500 data points for COM, X for BIZ
- In days between, there is a clear difference in how fast BIZ domains are flagged
- Biggest limitation was the size of our blacklist - original paper knew about tons of spam domains
    - We knew relatively few malware domains compared to millions of registered domains
- Unable to do 26 million WHOIS
    - But we did for about a million random domains in our data
    - Only counted the whois data if the creation_date was before or on malware blacklist date
    - Able to do whois for specifically all the domains we saw in malware blacklist

Note about data process: We sorted them to make it possible to diff.

To analyze:
- Percent chance that a COM/BIZ domain registered also appeared in our blacklist
- Make days between graph prettier
- Percent of malware domains from different registrars
- How many domains registered on a given day were eventually marked as malware (abnormal registration batches)
- Nameserver toxicity
- Days between removal and addition, and correlation with being malware

How many days of data exactly do we have?

Monthly statistics do not include any additions we saw where the NS had something like the word "EXPIRED" in it.

Analysis of "Days between registration and appearance":
- Ours goes well up to 300 days

Non Spammer VS Spammer Domain Counts Scatter Plot:
- We only have the registrar lookups for 1,890,519 of the domains we saw added t the zone file. This should account for about 14% of all domains added. Some limits came from time constraints, and others because created date was too late to be sure. This means that our results could look differently, if we had been able to collect the other 82% of data.

We can slightly do the first "days between use and registration" plot they have by doing the WHOIS (use who_malware_q script) on all the malware domains,
and comparing the creation date (latest one? maybe update date?) with the date added to blacklist.

Reg scatter plots should really be legend labeled by highest malware count, and outliers (only malware? right on the line?) should
be labelled too.

FILE:
BIZ_ns_data, COM_ns_data
- pickled dictionary of nameserver to all and bad domains lists.

BIZ_ns_tox_datapoints, COM_ns_tox_datapoints
- pickled list of ns,tox,bad_count tuples for the ns tox graph

biz_scatter_data, com_scatter_data
- pickled list of dicts with registrar, good counts, bad counts

biz_registrar_scatter_plot.py, com_registrar_scatter_plot.py
- plot from *_scatter_data

daily_biz_additions.txt
- number of additions, malware or not, to biz every day

daily_biz_malware_additions.txt, daily_com_malware_additions.txt
- number of malware additions to tld every day

CURRENTLY HAVE:
- daily_biz_malware_additions.txt
- daily_com_malware_additions.txt
- daily_biz_additions.txt
    - These have number of malware domains registered each day.
    - python ~/DomainsDjangoApp/manage.py daily_stats | tee daily_com_additions.txt running to collect daily_com_additions.txt in 18901.daily_any_additions

STILL TODO:
have com_ns_top_bad and com_ns_groupings_10, make for biz, then analyze both same


- get simple toxicity value for each NS for the graph, com and biz
- for a variety of spikes defined, look at % normal that would be in spike, and % malware that would be in spike
