Networks:
- Diagram of data filtering process for presentation
- Explicit adapted problem statement
- Interestingly, we saw a lot of cases where a domain appeared in the malware blacklists, and in the zone files, but the malware was first
    - So those cases didnâ€™t tell us anything about how long between registration and blacklisting
    - About half the data, so we end up with 2500 data points for COM, X for BIZ
- In days between, there is a clear difference in how fast BIZ domains are flagged
- Biggest limitation was the size of our blacklist - original paper knew about tons of spam domains
    - We knew relatively few malware domains compared to millions of registered domains
- Unable to do 26 million WHOIS
    - But we did for about a million random domains in our data
    - Only counted the whois data if the creation_date was before or on malware blacklist date
    - Able to do whois for specifically all the domains we saw in malware blacklist

Note about data process: We sorted them to make it possible to diff.

To analyze:
- Percent chance that a COM/BIZ domain registered also appeared in our blacklist
- Make days between graph prettier
- Percent of malware domains from different registrars
- How many domains registered on a given day were eventually marked as malware (abnormal registration batches)
- Nameserver toxicity
- Days between removal and addition, and correlation with being malware

How many days of data exactly do we have?

Monthly statistics do not include any additions we saw where the NS had something like the word "EXPIRED" in it.

Analysis of "Days between registration and appearance":
- Ours goes well up to 300 days

LAST THINGS
- screen -r 2644.whois still just adding as many whois to DB as possible

We can slightly do the first "days between use and registration" plot they have by doing the WHOIS (use who_malware_q script) on all the malware domains,
and comparing the creation date (latest one? maybe update date?) with the date added to blacklist.
