Hey Zhanna!

There are three things especially in this repo I think should be useful to you, to do some writing:

- "days_between_registration_and_appearance.png"
	- This is that first figure, of course.

- "biz_malware_whois_registrars.txt" and "com_malware_whois_registrars.txt"
	- I haven't actually turned these two files into results! Per se.
	- It would be great if you could sort the counts, and make the proper tables out of them.

- "tables.xlsx"
	- This has completed results/data. It's not pretty, it's just a shit excel table, but it is accurate.
